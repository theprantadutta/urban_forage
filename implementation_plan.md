## üé¨ Animation & Micro-Interaction Strategy

### Core Animation Philosophy
Every interaction should feel intentional, responsive, and delightful while maintaining performance.

### Key Animation Patterns

#### 1. Screen Transitions
```tsx
// Shared element transitions between screens
<SharedElement id="food-image">
  <Image source={foodImage} style={sharedImageStyle} />
</SharedElement>

// Custom page transitions with spring physics
const screenOptions = {
  cardStyleInterpolator: ({ current, layouts }) => ({
    cardStyle: {
      transform: [
        {
          translateX: current.progress.interpolate({
            inputRange: [0, 1],
            outputRange: [layouts.screen.width, 0],
          }),
        },
      ],
    },
  }),
};
```

#### 2. List Animations
```tsx
// Staggered list entrance
const listAnimation = useStaggeredAnimation(items.length, 100);

return (
  <FlatList
    data={items}
    renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
      <AnimatedListItem
        item={item}
        delay={listAnimation.getDelay(index)}
        animationType="slideUp"
      />
    )}
  />
);
```

#### 3. Micro-Interactions
- **Button Press:** Scale down with haptic feedback
- **Card Tap:** Subtle shadow expansion
- **Toggle States:** Smooth color transitions
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders with shimmer effects
- **Error States:** Gentle shake animations with color changes

### Performance Optimization
- Use `useNativeDriver` for all animations
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- Cache expensive calculations
