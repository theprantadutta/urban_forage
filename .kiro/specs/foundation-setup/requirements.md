# Requirements Document - Foundation Setup

## Introduction

This specification covers the foundational setup for UrbanForage, establishing the core infrastructure, design system, and authentication flows that will serve as the base for all subsequent features. The focus is on creating a premium visual foundation with exceptional user experience from the first interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Infrastructure and Design System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured project with a comprehensive design system, so that I can build consistent, beautiful UI components efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL have NativeWind configured with custom UrbanForage theme
2. WHEN a developer creates components THEN the system SHALL provide access to predefined color palette, typography, and spacing utilities
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL support dark mode with proper color scheme transitions
4. WHEN animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL use React Native Reanimated 3 with native driver support
5. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display consistent branding and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 2: Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and sign in securely, so that I can access personalized features and build my community profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user opens the app THEN the system SHALL present a beautiful onboarding flow with animated illustrations
2. WHEN a user chooses to sign up THEN the system SHALL offer multiple authentication methods (email, Google, Apple, Facebook)
3. WHEN a user provides authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL validate inputs with real-time feedback and micro-animations
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a user profile with basic information
5. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL remember their authentication state and provide seamless access
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
7. WHEN a user completes profile setup THEN the system SHALL enable biometric authentication if available

### Requirement 3: Core Navigation System

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation throughout the app, so that I can easily access different features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a custom tab bar with smooth transitions
2. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL provide fluid animations with shared element transitions
3. WHEN the user performs gestures THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate haptic feedback
4. WHEN the user accesses deep-linked content THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct screen with proper context
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded and restored THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation state and user context
6. WHEN the user interacts with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with scale and color transitions

### Requirement 4: Component Library Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive component library, so that I can build consistent interfaces quickly while maintaining design standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide reusable components (buttons, cards, inputs, modals)
2. WHEN components are used THEN the system SHALL support multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline) and sizes (small, medium, large)
3. WHEN users interact with components THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate animations and haptic feedback
4. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility standards with proper labels and focus management
5. WHEN components display loading states THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders with shimmer effects
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display consistent error states with recovery actions

### Requirement 5: Performance and Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be fast and responsive, so that I can accomplish tasks efficiently without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL reach interactive state within 3 seconds
2. WHEN screen transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps with frame times under 16ms
3. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL display progressive loading with optimized caching
4. WHEN animations run THEN the system SHALL use native driver for optimal performance
5. WHEN the app is used on lower-end devices THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance through optimization
6. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate offline indicators and cached content
